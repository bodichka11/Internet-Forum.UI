# Web Application: Single-Page Application (Angular)

In this task, you must design and develop a web application according to the requirements that are specified in the task description.

The brief description of the technologies to use in this task is:
* The client (front-end) application must be built on top of the Angular framework.
* The client application must be built using HTML, CSS and TypeScript (or JavaScript).

Depending on the requirements, the task may include requirements for developing a Web API application (back-end). The back-end application code must be added to a *separate repository*.


## Task Description

This document describes only the [non-functional requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-functional_requirement) for the application being developed. You must either develop [functional requirements](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Functional_requirement) by yourself, depending on the topic received, or receive them from another source (a mentor, lecturer, or learning path).

Before starting the development, put the task code you have received into the [README.md](README.md) file:

TASK CODE: PUT THE TASK CODE YOU RECEIVED HERE.


### NodeJs

The client application must target [NodeJS 18.12.0](https://nodejs.org/dist/v18.12.0) (or higher).

Please, check what version of NodeJS you have installed before starting the development:

```cmd
C:\>node --version
v18.12.0
```


### Git

* Do all your development on the *main* branch.
* [Do commit early and often](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/).
* [Do make useful commit messages](https://sethrobertson.github.io/GitBestPractices/).
* You are allowed to create your own branches, but at the end, the code must be merged into the *main* branch.
* Do not create merge requests unless asked to do so by staff.
* The [.gitignore](.gitignore) file is added to this Git repository, which configures Git to ignore files created by the Visual Studio and compilers.


### Angular

Install the Angular CLI:

```sh
npm install -g @angular/cli
```

The workspace and the initial started app have already been added to the repository. You are allowed to update the Angular version and replace the existing application files.
